### About

A modpack with a technological focus on Create, and an adventorous one at exploration and role-playing, with classes and origins. There's also a questbook with a story-line (can be safely ignored) and a walkthrough of Create and Botania (W.I.P.).

You can find a categorized version of the modlist [here](https://github.com/FTEdianiaK/the-fox-revolution/blob/main/modlist.cat.md).
