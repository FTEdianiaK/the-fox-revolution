### About

A modpack with a technological focus on Create, and an adventorous one at exploration and role-playing, with classes and origins. There's also a questbook with a story-line (can be safely ignored) and a walkthrough of Create and Botania.

### Computer Specs

I personally use:

- RAM: 8GB (max.)
- Graphics: RTX 3070, 8GB
- Java: [JDK 17](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=17&package=jdk)

### Shader Pack

- Recommended - [Complementary Unbound](https://modrinth.com/shader/complementary-unbound)
